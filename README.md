# Angular UI Kit by [ng.guide](https://ng.guide/ui-kit)

UI Kit is a modern, modular UI component library for Angular — built **from scratch**, guided by the course [ng.guide](https://ng.guide/ui-kit).  
This is not a wrapper around Angular Material — it’s a fresh implementation of Material Design principles with full transparency, customizability, and learning in mind.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

UI Kit is being built **in public**, component by component, as part of the Angular UI Kit course. The goal is to provide both a reusable component set **and** an educational reference for building high-quality Angular libraries.

> Join the course or jump into issues and PRs — everyone’s welcome.
